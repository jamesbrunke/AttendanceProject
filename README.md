## Java based Attendence Project##

Project was created for no particular purpose. The web application is networked with a Oracle SQL database on the host machine. See DB.properties for more details if you wish to use the application, you will need to configure your own database locally. In the future I will be adding the database to the image so no external work is required by the user - just a docker run.

Project uses JSPs/servlets for routing.

Project Uses old Log4J for logging. Vulnerable to the recent CVE-2021-44228.
